    "**Predicting Loan Defaults**  \n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan defaults based on customer behavior. Accurately identifying potential defaulters enables financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, manage risk effectively, and maintain financial stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**  \n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is complex due to various influencing factors, including customer demographics (e.g., age, income, employment status), financial history (e.g., credit history, existing debts), and loan characteristics (e.g., loan amount, interest rate). Traditional credit scoring models may not capture these nuances, leading to suboptimal risk assessments. Machine learning offers a data-driven approach to enhance predictive accuracy in identifying potential defaulters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**  \n",
    "The dataset comprises customer information provided at the time of the loan application. The data is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/loan-prediction-based-on-customer-behavior), specifically the \"Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior\" dataset by Subham Jain. \n",
