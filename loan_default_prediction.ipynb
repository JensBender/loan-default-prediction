    "**Predicting Loan Defaults**  \n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether the customers of a financial institution will default on a loan based on data from their loan application. Accurately identifying potential defaulters enables financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, adjust loan terms, and better manage financial risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**  \n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is complex due to various influencing factors, including customer demographics (e.g., age, income, profession) and other background information such as house ownership and years in the job. Traditional credit scoring models often rely on limited historical data and linear relationships, which can oversimplify risk assessment. Machine learning, however, can capture non-linear patterns and complex interactions among variables, improving the accuracy of default predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**  \n",
    "The dataset contains information provided by customers of a financial institution during the loan application process. It is sourced from the \"Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior\" dataset by Subham Jain, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhamjain/loan-prediction-based-on-customer-behavior). \n",

    "**Objectives**  \n",
    "The project aims to:\n",
    "- Develop a machine learning model to predict loan defaults based on customer data from loan applications.\n",
    "- Evaluate and compare different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.\n",
    "- Analyze feature importance to understand key factors driving loan default risk.\n",
    "\n",
